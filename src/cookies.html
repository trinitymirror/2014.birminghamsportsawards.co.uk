<h1 class="heading--main">Cookie Policy</h1>

<p>Like most websites, this one uses cookies.</p>

<p>Cookies are small text files stored on your computer by your browser. They're used
for many things, such as remembering whether you've visited the site before, so that
you remain logged in - or to help us work out how many new website visitors we
get each month. They contain information about the use of your computer but don't
include personal information about you (they don't store your name, for instance).</p>

<p>This policy explains how cookies are used on Trinity Mirror websites in general
– and, below, how you can control the cookies that may be used on this site (not
all of them are used on every site).</p>

<h2>About this Cookie policy</h2>

<p>This Cookie Policy applies to all of our websites and our mobile applications (“the
Website”).</p>

<p>In this Cookie Policy, when we refer to any of our Websites, we mean any website or
mobile application operated by or on behalf of Trinity Mirror plc or its subsidiaries
and affiliates (collectively "Trinity Mirror"), regardless of how you access the
network. This Cookie Policy forms part of and is incorporated into our Website Terms
and Conditions.</p>

<p>By accessing the Website, you agree that this Cookie Policy will apply whenever you
access the Website on any device.</p>

<p>Any changes to this policy will be posted here. We reserve the right to vary this
Cookie Policy from time to time and such changes shall become effective as soon as
they are posted. Your continued use of the Website constitutes your agreement to all
such changes.</p>

<h2>Our use of cookies</h2>

<p>We may collect information automatically when you visit the Website, using cookies.</p>

<p>The cookies allow us to identify your computer and find out details about your last
visit.</p>

<p>You can choose, below, not to allow cookies. If you do, we can't guarantee that your
experience with the Website will be as good as if you do allow cookies.</p>

<p>The information collected by cookies does not personally identify you; it includes
general information about your computer settings, your connection to the Internet
e.g. operating system and platform, IP address, your browsing patterns and timings of
browsing on the Website and your location.</p>

<p>Most internet browsers accept cookies automatically, but you can change the settings
of your browser to erase cookies or prevent automatic acceptance if you prefer.</p>

<p>These links explain how you can control cookies via your browser – remember that if
you turn off cookies in your browser then these settings apply to all websites not just
this one:</p>

<h2>Types of cookie that may be used during your visit to the Website:</h2>

<p>The following types of cookie are used on this site. We don't list every single cookie
used by name – but for each type of cookie we tell you how you can control its use.</p>

<h3>1. Personalisation cookies</h3>

<p>These cookies are used to recognise repeat visitors to the Website and in conjunction
with other information we hold to attempt to record specific browsing information
(that is, about the way you arrive at the Website, pages you view, options you select,
information you enter and the path you take through the Website). These are used to
recommend content we think you'll be interested in based on what you're looked at
before.</p>

<p>This site, however, does not use personalisation and so these cookies are not used.</p>

<h3>2. Analytics cookies</h3>

<p>These monitor how visitors move around the Website and how they reached it. This is
used so that we can see total (not individual) figures on which types of content users
enjoy most, for instance.</p>

<p>You can opt out of these if you want:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Omniture:</strong> <a href="http://www.omniture.com/sv/privacy/visualsciences/policy/">http://www.omniture.com/sv/privacy/visualsciences/policy/</a></li>
  <li><strong>Google:</strong> <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Third-party service cookies</h3>

<p>Social sharing, video and other services we offer are run by other companies. These
companies may drop cookies on your computer when you use them on our site or if
you are already logged in to them.</p>

<p>Here is a list of places where you can find out more about specific services that we
may use and their use of cookies:</p>

<h3>4. Our own ad serving and management cookies</h3>

<p>We sell space on some of our websites to advertisers – they pay for the content you
enjoy for free.</p>

<p>As part of this, we use several services to help us and advertisers understand what
adverts you might be interested in. These cookies hold information about the
computer – they don't hold personal information about you (ie it's not linked to
you as an individual). But they might hold a record of what other websites you've
looked at – so we could show you a car advert if you've previously visited a motoring
website.</p>

<p>These are the services we use and how you can control those cookies. Please
note that turning off advertising cookies won't mean that you are not served any
advertising merely that it will not be tailored to your interests.</p>

<h3>5. Other ad management cookies</h3>

<p>Advertisements on the Website are provided by other organisations. Our advertising
partners will serve advertisements that they believe are most likely to be of interest
to you, based on information about your visit to the Website and other websites. In
order to do this, our advertising partner may need to place a cookie on your computer.
These cookies hold information about the computer – they don't hold personal
information about you (ie it's not linked to you as an individual).</p>

<p>For more information about this type of online behavioural advertising, about cookies,and about how to turn this feature off, please visit <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/</a></p>

<p>Please note that turning off advertising cookies won't mean that you are not served
any advertising merely that it will not be tailored to your interests.</p>

<h3>6. Site management cookies</h3>

<p>These are used to maintain your identity or session on the Website. For instance, where our websites run on more than one server, we use a cookie to ensure that you are sent information by one specific server (otherwise you may log in or out unexpectedly). We may use similar cookies when you vote in opinion polls to ensure that you can only vote once, and to ensure that you can use our commenting functionality when not logged in (to ensure you don't see comments you've reported as abusive, for instance, or don't vote comments up/down more than once).</p>

<p>These cookies cannot be turned off individually but you could change your browser
setting to refuse all cookies ( see above) if you do not wish to accept them.</p>
